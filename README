About
-----

This directory contains the planner POPF2.  The original incarnation of POPF
is described in the ICAPS 2010 paper "Forward-Chaining Partial-Order Planning."
by Amanda Coles, Andrew Coles, Maria Fox and Derek Long.  This version
extends POPF by introducing any-time search, allowing it to optimise solution
quality.

Compiling
---------

POPF2 requires:
- cmake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
- the CBC mixed integer programming solver ( https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc/ )
- perl, bison and flex to build the parser

These are packaged with most linux distributions - on Ubuntu/Debian, the
following should suffice:

sudo apt-get install cmake coinor-libcbc-dev coinor-libclp-dev \
                     coinor-libcoinutils-dev bison flex


After that, run ./build


Running
-------

Run:

./plan <domain> <problem> <solution filename>

As POPF2 is an any-time planer, it will save sequentially numbered plans.
